# scalar-MHD
This project aims to simulate the behavior of one-dimensional MHD (Magnetohydrodynamics) models, i.e., reduced MHD models with scalar velocity and magnetic fields. We are mainly interested in the interaction between the velocity field and the magnetic field.

The first model comes from Thomas (1968). Thomas simplied the imcompressible MHD model and proposed a scalar MHD.
